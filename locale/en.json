        "descriptionOne": "Founded in 2019, Danielle started this company with an agency framework and vision for working with clients in a variety of arenas— primarily branding, social media marketing and business development support. Despite the pandemic, it was an exciting time of immediate growth and in 2021, she teamed up with her (now) husband to offer full-service app and e-commerce websites to meet client demand. Although this pivot was fruitful, she quickly realized that their combined talents were not geared towards client acquisition but rather, the actual technical work.",
